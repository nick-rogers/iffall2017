		<li>I hope to learn how to design better and more interactive digital interfaces. I want to have a more 
		informed and purposeful design process when working on the screen.</li>
		<li>Designing for a screen brings with it added challenges along with conveniences. I will make sure to 
		keep sketching and planning, because it is easy not to save your work and progress when you are working on 
		a screen. It is fun to experiement and just change around html and CSS but coming in with a plan beforehand is 
		important</li>
		<li><a href="https://www.box.com">Box.com</a> Is a site that utilizes very effective design. It is a little over-the-top 
		with its animations but it is very visually compelling</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.bbc.com">BBC.com</a> is a site that is very effective at communicating its message. I use this site
		several times a day and it succeeds to quickly communicate to me the day's news with its straightforward layout</li>
		<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> Is a website that works very well. I don't love the visual design, but
		it makes purchasing products as easy as one click</li>
