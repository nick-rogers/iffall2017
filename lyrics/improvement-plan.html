  <h1>Nick Roger Lyric Site<br/>Improvement Plan</h1>
  <ul style="text-align: left;">
  	<li>I created my own version of the background artwork I used in the original design so the resolution would be higher and the image would appear cleaner</li>
  	<li>I lengthened the webpage and spaced out the lyric sections for better pacing for the reader</li>
  	<li>The original handwritten font did not relate well with the surrounding imagery so I changed the typeface</li>
  	<p>Edits were made with the help of Jane Kye and Marina Hartzell Gallegos</p>
  </ul>
